# Applied Economic & Numerical Analysis (Python)
**Selected Jupyter notebooks demonstrating applied numerical methods and optimisation for economic decision-making.**

This repository contains selected Python notebooks applying numerical methods
and economic modelling techniques to practical decision-making problems.

The focus is on using quantitative tools in a way that is **interpretable,
robust, and relevant**, rather than purely theoretical or abstract.

## What This Work Demonstrates

- Application of numerical methods for function approximation
- Use of optimisation techniques to solve constrained and unconstrained problems
- Implementation of iterative and simulation-based approaches
- Comparison of alternative modelling techniques and error behaviour
- Interpretation of quantitative results using economic intuition
- Clear communication of results through visualisation and structured analysis

These skills are directly applicable to roles in **strategy, operations,
analytics, and data-informed decision-making**.

## Included Notebooks

### Applied Numerical Methods & Optimisation (PS6)
This notebook applies and compares different numerical approaches to function
approximation and optimisation.

The work applies:
- Polynomial and spline-based approximation techniques
- Analysis of convergence, numerical stability, and approximation error
- Numerical optimisation routines for economic-style objective functions
- Evaluation of trade-offs between precision and computational efficiency

The emphasis is on understanding **when and why certain methods perform better**
than others, rather than treating numerical techniques as black boxes.

### Applied Numerical Modelling & Iterative Methods (PS8)
This notebook applies numerical and iterative methods to solve economic-style
models that do not admit closed-form solutions.

The work applies:
- Iterative algorithms for solving non-linear problems
- Simulation of model outcomes under varying parameter values
- Sensitivity analysis to assess robustness of results
- Interpretation of numerical solutions in an economic context

This analysis highlights how numerical methods can be used to explore model
behaviour and support decisions under uncertainty.

## Academic Context

The notebooks in this repository were completed as part of a
**Programming and Numerical Methods for Economics** university module.

Eight problem sets were completed in total; the two included here were
deliberately selected as the most representative of applied numerical
modelling, optimisation, and economic interpretation.

These notebooks were selected based on clarity of insight and the ability to
translate quantitative results into practical conclusions.

## How to View

Notebook files (`.ipynb`) are rendered directly on GitHub — no local setup is
required.

## Notes

- All notebooks run end-to-end without modification
- Code is commented for clarity and reproducibility
- Results are discussed in terms of economic meaning, not just numerical output
