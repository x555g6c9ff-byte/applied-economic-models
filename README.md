# Applied Economic & Numerical Analysis (Python)

This repository contains selected Python notebooks applying numerical methods
and economic modelling techniques to practical decision-making problems.

The focus is on using quantitative tools in a way that is **interpretable,
robust, and relevant**, rather than purely theoretical or abstract.

## What This Work Demonstrates

- Application of numerical methods for function approximation
- Use of optimisation techniques to solve constrained and unconstrained problems
- Implementation of iterative and simulation-based approaches
- Comparison of alternative modelling techniques and error behaviour
- Interpretation of quantitative results using economic intuition
- Clear communication of results through visualisation and structured analysis

These skills are directly applicable to roles in **strategy, operations,
analytics, and data-informed decision-making**.

## Included Notebooks

### Applied Numerical Methods & Optimisation (PS6)
This notebook evaluates different numerical approaches to function
approximation and optimisation.

It includes:
- Comparison of polynomial and spline-based approximation techniques
- Analysis of convergence, numerical stability, and approximation error
- Application of numerical optimisation routines to economic-style objective
  functions
- Discussion of trade-offs between precision and computational efficiency

The emphasis is on understanding when and why certain methods perform better
than others, rather than treating numerical techniques as black boxes.

### Applied Numerical Modelling & Iterative Methods (PS8)
This notebook applies numerical and iterative methods to solve economic-style
models that do not admit closed-form solutions.

It includes:
- Implementation of iterative algorithms for non-linear problems
- Simulation of model outcomes under different parameter values
- Sensitivity analysis to assess robustness
- Interpretation of numerical solutions in an economic context

This work highlights how numerical methods can be used to explore model
behaviour and support decisions under uncertainty.

## Academic Context

The notebooks in this repository were completed as part of a
**Programming and Numerical Methods for Economics** university module.

Eight problem sets were completed in total; the two included here were
deliberately selected as the most representative of applied numerical
modelling, optimisation, and economic interpretation.

## Notes

- All notebooks run end-to-end without modification
- Code is commented for clarity and reproducibility
- Results are discussed in terms of economic meaning, not just numerical output
